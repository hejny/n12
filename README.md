## üï∏ Try `@promptbook/utils`

This package is fully functional, but I have decided to deprecate it in favor of [@promptbook/utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@promptbook/utils) package. The reason is that the new package has more features for text manipulation and especially for manipulation of texts going in and out of LLMs.

You can still perfectly use this package, but I will not be adding new features to it.

Every feature of this package is also available in the new package. The new package also has more features.
